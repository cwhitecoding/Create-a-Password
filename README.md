# Create-a-Password

## Description

This site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this site is to use JavaScript functions that randomizes characters to create a password. This is an easy way to come up with passwords that can be more secure than someone may have thought of before. During the creation of this site I learned much more about functions, for loops, and how JavaScript works. I utilized the use of arrays, objects, alerts, and confirmation methods.
